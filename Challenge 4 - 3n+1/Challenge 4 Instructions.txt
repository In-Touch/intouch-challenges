In-Touch Programming Challenge #4 - 3n+1
========================================

Consider the following algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers:

Start with an integer $n. If $n is even, divide by 2. If $n is odd, multiply 
by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process with the new value of $n, terminating 
when $n = 1. For example, the following sequence of numbers will be generated 
for $n = 22:

	22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

For an input $n, the cycle-length of $n is the number of numbers generated up 
to and including the 1. In the example above, the cycle length of 22 is 16. 
Given any two numbers $i and $j, you are to determine the maximum cycle length 
over all numbers between $i and $j, including both endpoints. Your program
should output $i, $j, the number $n that has the highest cycle length and what
that maximum cycle length is.

The input numbers $i and $j will be positive integers between (and inclusive of)
1 and 1,000,000.
